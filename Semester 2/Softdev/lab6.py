# ABC Ltd. employees 4 salespeople, each of which have a weekly sales target to meet, (assume for
# version 1 there is just a single weekly target figure which all salesmen try to reach), the weekly
# target figure should be input by the user.
#
# All the salespeople attempt to meet this target, by entering daily sales figures, that is, for each
# salesperson five daily figures are entered during a week, i.e. you have to create a 2D list with 4 rows
# and 5 columns in each row.
#
# The program calculates the weekly sales figure from the daily figures entered for each salesperson
# and output that weekly figure for each salesperson. In addition, the program outputs any
# salespersonâ€™s number who exceeded the weekly target and the amount by which they exceeded that
# target.

# At the end of the run the program outputs the total sales for the week and the number of
# salespersons who exceeded the target figure.
