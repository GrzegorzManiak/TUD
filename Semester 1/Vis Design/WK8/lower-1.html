            <p>
                <i>Lorem ipsum </i>is placeholder text commonly used in the graphic, print, and publishing industries for previewing layouts and visual mockups.

                Lorem ipsum, or lipsum as it is sometimes known, is dummy text used in laying out print, graphic or web designs. The passage is attributed to an unknown typesetter in the 15th century who is thought to have scrambled parts of Cicero's De Finibus Bonorum
                et Malorum for use in a type specimen book. It usually begins with:
                <blockquote>
                    “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.”
                </blockquote>
            </p>
            <h2>Fuzzy Beginnings</h2>
            <h3>Creation timelines for the standard lorem ipsum passage vary, with some citing the 15th century and others the 20th.</h3>
            <p>
                So how did the classical Latin become so incoherent? According to McClintock, a 15th century typesetter likely scrambled part of Cicero's De Finibus in order to provide placeholder text to mockup various fonts for a type specimen book. It's difficult
                to find examples of lorem ipsum in use before Letraset made it popular as a dummy text in the 1960s, although McClintock says he remembers coming across the lorem ipsum passage in a book of old metal type samples. So far he hasn't relocated
                where he once saw the passage, but the popularity of Cicero in the 15th century supports the theory that the filler text has been used for centuries. And anyways, as Cecil Adams reasoned, “[Do you really] think graphic arts supply houses
                were hiring classics scholars in the 1960s?” Perhaps. But it seems reasonable to imagine that there was a version in use far before the age of Letraset. McClintock wrote to Before & After to explain his discovery;
                <blockquote>
                    “What I find remarkable is that this text has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since some printer in the 1500s took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book; it has survived not only four centuries of letter-by-letter
                    resetting but even the leap into electronic typesetting, essentially unchanged except for an occasional 'ing' or 'y' thrown in. It's ironic that when the then-understood Latin was scrambled, it became as incomprehensible as Greek;
                    the phrase 'it's Greek to me' and 'greeking' have common semantic roots!” (The editors published his letter in a correction headlined “Lorem Oopsum”).
